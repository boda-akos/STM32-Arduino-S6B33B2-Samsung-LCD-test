# STM32-Arduino-S6B33B3-Samsung-LCD-test
Color stripes and text, some graphics like fillRect. Todo: rewrite and test all graphics functions.

A chinese vendor sells these displays at 0.99$ on Aliexp., it is a S6B33B3 which is significally different from B2.

Not the best quality - technology is 10-15 years old - but could be used in many projects.
