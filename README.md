# STM32-Arduino-S6B33B2-Samsung-LCD-test
Color stripes and text, some graphics. Todo: modify and test all graphics functions.
A chinese vendor sells these displays at 0.99$, in fact it is a S6B33B3 which is significally different.
Not the best quality - technology 12 years ago - but could be used in many projects.
